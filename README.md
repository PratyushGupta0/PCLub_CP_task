This is an interactive problem.
There are three code files:
Solution.cpp : This contains the solution to the problem.
test_generator.cpp: Given the number of testcases, it generates the required testcases. At the same time, there is some data that must be generated which is not
                    directly revealed to the user, and information about it is given out through queries. This is stored in a vector for further use.
evaluator.cpp: This file models the evaluator, it takes in reads the queries and answers them and also checks the final output. 

As of now, all the files are publishing and taking inputon the stdin and stdout channels, which is something that needs rectification.
